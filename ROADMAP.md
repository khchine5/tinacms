# Roadmap

The TinaCMS core team is a part of Forestry.io. The purpose of
this document is to communicate to the greater community how the
TinaCMS core team will prioritize upcoming development.

## Process

The TinaCMS core team follows an 8 week development cycle:

- 6 weeks of development
- 2 week cooldown.

TinaCMS is a toolkit for building content management systems. In
order to improve this toolkit, the core team works on various
projects to directly or indirectly push TinaCMS forward. These
projects are pitched to the team in well scoped documents that
describe their value to the TinaCMS open source toolkit and it's
sponsors. The team chooses the projects it wants to take on for
the next 6 weeks. Any improvements that are made to the `tinacms/tinacms` repository during that time will be part of the regular weekly release.
At the end of that 6 weeks the team takes 2 weeks to step back, gain
perspective, and plan the next 6 week period.

## Cycles

### Cycle 2: July 13th to August 21st

| Begins        | Ends           |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| May 18th 2020 | June 26th 2020 |

As the project has grown the website's structure has proved problematic for contributors.
Deciding where to put new docs and where to look for files to be changed has been
challenging. We've also found that our messaging around Tina has lead to some misconceptions
that we would like to correct. This cycle we are focussing on improving the documentation and 
messaging around TinaCMS.
